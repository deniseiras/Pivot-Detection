ABSTRACT

This paper presents a technique to identify central pivot (CP) using patches of images containing only one CP, composed by varied bands of the Landsat 8 OLI sensor and spectral indices, through a fast Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Different combinations of bands and indexes were tested in this work, as infrared band and NDVI. The obtained results indicate best accuracy (95,85%) when using bands not commonly used in CNNs, surpassing some works. CNN also demonstrated advantages in terms of speed, by classifying a patch of image containing CP in only 0.28 milliseconds, revealing great potential for CP identification in remote sensing images, available in official catalogs.
